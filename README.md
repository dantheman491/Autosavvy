# PlanetSavvy


### App Title: PlanetSavvy

### App Description:

Space is a thing of wonder for many. Ever wonder what would happen if a photographer took an image of a celestial body everyday? What inspirations would come of such observations? Imagine no more with PlanetSavvy. 

### API: 
The API used is from NASA https://api.nasa.gov//. I intend to get the picture of a celestial body and an explation from the photographer on said image. User should also be able to select a new image based on a date set by the API

### API and Data Sample: cut it

### MVP (Minimal Viable Product: 
1. Build out Html, CSS, and JS
2. It will include a drop down menu that will allow the user to select a news and an input for a user to search for something specifc.
3. Once the search is complete the search will show specific image associated with the date along with a thought from the photographer.
4. If the user is not satisfied with the selections, they will be able to refresh and go to the picture of the day.

### Post MVP: 
1. Like to add at least 2 more endpoints to broaden the content 
2. Adding media space for adds. This will allow monetization in the future
3. I would like to add video.
4. I would like to animation to the title. 
5. I would like to add audio to the background. 
6. Save to local storage
