## App Description**: Provides images and a brief explanation on the celestial body.

## API: 
The API used is from NASA https://api.nasa.gov//. I intend to get the picture of a celestial body and an explation from the photographer on said image. User should also be able to select a new image based on a date set by the API.

## MVP: 
1. It will include a drop down menu that will allow the user to select a news and an input for a user to search for something specifc.
2. Once the search is complete the search will show specific image associated with the date along with a thought from the photographer.
3. If the user is not satisfied with the selections, they will be able to refresh and go to the picture of the day.


## Post MVP: 
1. Like to add at least 2 more endpoints to broaden the content 
2. Adding media space for adds. This will allow monetization in the future
3. I would like to add video.
4. I would like to animation to the title. 
5. I would like to add audio to the background.
